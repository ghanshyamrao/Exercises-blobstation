                <h1>Whatever You Do, Don't Put Coffee Grounds in Your Garden</h1>
                <p>
                    There's nothing like eating veggies you grew in your own garden. But
                    gardening is a big investment: there's the daily watering, the
                    careful pest control, and the delicate process of keeping the soil
                    chemistry just right. The internet is full of ways you can make
                    gardening easier and cheaper, but some methods are too good to be
                    true. No matter what the gardening blogs tell you, leave the spent
                    coffee grounds alone. They're bad news for your garden.

                <p>
                    The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused internet disruptions
                    across the country since Thursday, according to monitoring group
                    NetBlocks. “Disruptions have subsequently been tracked across much
                    of Ukraine including capital city Kyiv as Russia’s military
                    operation progresses.” With Russian troops advancing and missiles
                    hitting key infrastructure, Fedorov’s plea was answered.

                <h1>How Spider Geckos Survive in the World’s Hottest Desert</h1>
                <p>
                    The surface temperatures of the Lut Desert in Iran skyrocket to over
                    150 degrees Fahrenheit more often than anywhere else on earth.
                    Considered mostly barren, this desert’s harsh environment makes it a
                    difficult home for any life to thrive. Enter the spider gecko. These
                    small nocturnal lizards can withstand harsh summer temperatures and
                    extreme winter night lows. These tiny reptiles have long slender
                    legs and a tail to help them climb in their rocky habitats.
